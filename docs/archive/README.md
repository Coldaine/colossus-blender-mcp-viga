# Archive

This directory contains documentation and source code files that are considered obsolete or have been superseded by the new architecture defined in:

-   `docs/MASTER_REQUIREMENTS.md`
-   `docs/plans/phase_1_mvp_inner_loop.md`
-   `docs/plans/phase_2_broad_search.md`

These files have been moved here to avoid confusion and to keep the main `docs/` and `src/` directories clean and aligned with the current development plan. They are preserved for historical context but should not be referenced for new work.
